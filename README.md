# PirateShop

This is a web application that simulates a shop that sells pirated Star Wars movies. Discounts are applied when your cart either contains at least one of each DVD or at least one of each Blu-Ray or if you have 100 or more items in your cart. Classes.py holds the code for the Shop class and the Item class, views.py controls the web app, and index.html codes the website text and buttons. You can run the app through run.py.
